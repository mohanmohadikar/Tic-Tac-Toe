It's a simple tic-tac-toe game in which you need to .<br/>
I have simply used 9 div's to create grid for this game.<br/>
When we make move in game, alternatively the concerned div eement is marked with either 'X' or 'O'.<br/>
With the help of CSS,  I've added design to grid in project along with some howering effect<br/>
